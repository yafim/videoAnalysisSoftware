				Please note that this is a beta version of the video analysis software which is still undergoing final testing and modifications before its official release.<br><br>
				This software provides the ability to mark different AOIs within the video and intersect it with collected eye data (a standart json file generated by default from 'eyeTribe' eyetracker).<br><br>

				By clicking on View->Statistics you'll be able to analyse the user's gaze during the video related to the AOIs you chose. <br><br>

				As a user of this beta, youâ€™re invited to join a community of testers, reviewers, and bug-catchers. We're grateful for your help as we develop towards a stable release. We welcome feedback, suggestions, name suggestions, and the identification of flaws, glitches, and bugs. <br><br>

				To report a bug or suggestion, please send email to : ifim.vo@gmail.com<br><br>

				Thank you again and I hope you enjoy,<br>
				Yafim.
