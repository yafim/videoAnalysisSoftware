# Beta disclaimer
Please note that this is a beta version of the video analysis software which is still undergoing final testing and modifications before its official release.

This software provides the ability to mark different AOIs within the video and intersect it with collected eye data.

By clicking on View->Statistics you'll be able to analyse the user's gaze during the video related to the AOIs you chose.

As a user of this beta, youâ€™re invited to join a community of testers, reviewers, and bug-catchers. We're grateful for your help as we develop towards a stable release. We welcome feedback, suggestions, name suggestions, and the identification of flaws, glitches, and bugs.

To report a bug or suggestion, please send email to : ifim.vo@gmail.com

Thank you again and I hope you enjoy,
Yafim
