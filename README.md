# Introduction
This Video player analyzes a JSON file containing coordinates and timestamps (the JSON data corresponds to the frames in a video track - this file will be built in advance using EyeLog software) to present relevant pixels, according to time, on the screen using heatmap.js.

# Motivation
* Understanding user's video viewing behavior (Eye tracking technology, EEG, Cursor behavior, etc.) 

# Requirements
* Create JSON file with EyeLog (based on eyeTribe software) - [EyeLog  GitHub](https://github.com/yafim/eyeLog)
* JSON example containing 2 coordinates
Note! You can generate your own json file from any eye tracker using this format

```<JSON>
{
 "data":[
	{
	 "x": 1008,
	 "y": 582,
	 "timeStamp" : "00:00:00.0030017",
	  "second" : "0";
	 },
	{
	 "x": 1008,
	 "y": 580,
	 "timeStamp" : "00:00:00.0230138",
	  "second" : "0"
	 },
	{}
]}
```

# How to use it
